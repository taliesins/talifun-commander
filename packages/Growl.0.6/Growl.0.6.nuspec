    <description>Includes libraries for sending growl notifications from your applications (functionality as in the .NET SDK).
Also includes a helper class to enable sending of simple notifications with just one line of code:

GrowlHelper.simpleGrowl("Hello World", "This is my message");

The helper only seems to work with WinForms apps at the moment, but the libraries still allow you to use growl from your websites too.
I do not own Growl. I just put it into a NuGet package. All original code belongs to Christopher Forsythe and the Growl Team.</description>
